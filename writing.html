	      <h1>a note</h1>
	      <p>me've been working toward getting back all of my old writing, dating it, and keeping it stored somewhere. for a really long time, what i would do would be to write something, maybe upload it somewhere, and then in waves i would delete whole collections of my writing. it's been hard, now that i care a lot more about preserving these sorts of things, to go back where i can, pull out old hard drives, etc to find rough drafts of writings. lots of my writing was done pen and paper, or on my typewriter, and then lost or visibly obscured with marker.</p>
	      <p>it sucks hard knowing these years and years of writing, my own history, has been erased due to embarassment. not only that, but other things as well. i don't have any art from long ago, because i wouldn't even save or upload art, i would create and delete. and, of course, regarding local storage, young me was a tech savvy little fuck who encrypted shit and then forgot the password. </p>
	      <p>take as much of this with some context: i'm doing better now, and a lot of these writings being edgy are the ones that i find the most important. as i date the writings to when i think they were made, it gives me insight into remembering what may have caused me to write these poems in the past.. i usually struggle with memory and seeing these helps put into context lots of things about my life. </p>
	      <p>mostly haiku, freeform, maybe a few short stories. lots of my writing is fanfiction but i don't feel like putting any of that there, and NO you will not get to read any. maybe going forward i'll write or put some of my small essays or developed thoughts on things.</p>

	      <h4>Understate - Late 2019</h4>
	      <p><i>I dreamed of you last night. <br>
The black and white girl,<br>
eyes wide open with<br>
“little circles” written on your face.<br>
<br>

I dreamed of you last night. <br>
The euphony of the city,<br>
the ocean, the wind,<br>
Every little thing pouring into my ears.<br>
<br>
I dreamed of you last night,<br> 
and I fully understood <br>
the feelings you have <br>
not yet taken the time to think about.<br>
<br>
I dreamed of you last night,<br> 
dreaming on your way home from school,<br>
with the pressure in your chest <br>
of knowing it was all going to end.<br>
<br>
I dreamed of you last night,<br> 
the sky was falling down<br>
and crashing into the world<br>
you could feel crumbling.<br>
<br>
And that’s okay,<br>
		      as long as you have your dreams.</i></p>
	      <p>Notes: this was made for a writing contest off of an album i like, <a href="https://vill4in.bandcamp.com/album/--5">listen here.</a>it did not win.</p>
<br>
<br>
	      <h4>Birth of a New Day - late 2019</h4>
		<p><i>No words<br>
could <br>
describe this feeling. <br>
<br>
The city that forces its way into my eyes<br>
brings only the greatest of peace to my soul.<br>
The metal and neon must weigh a million pounds,<br>
but the stone in my chest is much heavier.<br>
<br>
No matter what happens, I keep coming back to you.<br>
<br>
When the rain fills into me,<br> 
and the static electricity jolts through my flesh,<br>
and the purple blur of the city is all I can see,<br>
and the soft, reassuring waves of sound conquer my thoughts<br>
and bring me to the most angelic emotion to ever find my soul,<br>
whispering “do not be afraid,”<br>
			is when I can finally understand how true love feels.</i></p>
		<p>Notes: this was also made for the writing contest in 10 minutes and it fucking sucks. ignore it. based off of <a href="https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--18">this album</a></p>
<br>
<br>
		      <h4>Blooming - late 2019</h4>
		      <p><i>I wish that I had thorns like a thistle,<br>
with wondrous vines as my waving hair.<br>
I wish my voice was that of a whistle,<br>
with my singing song pretty and fair.<br>
<br>
I wish that I had flowers like a rose, <br>
delicate, beautiful, of esprit.<br>
Instead I sit quiet, and no one knows,<br>
the rough bark on the mind of this tree. <br>
<br>
As young as I am, I’ll get my festoon,<br>
I’m just in my phase of folia.  <br>
My flowers will come, albeit not soon,<br> 
			      the soft white buds of magnolia.</i></p>
		      <p>Notes: this won said contest as like 2nd place or something. it has an edgy line and i didn't want to display it, but when i told the teacher running the contest that she got actually so fuckin offended. she looked at me like i had killed her dog. anyways</p>
<br>
<br>
	      <h4>3 AM - late 2018</h4>
	      <p><i>The shine of the moon,<br>
and the glimmer of the stars...<br>
		      Damn mortality.</i></p>
	      <p>Notes: this is nice</p>
<br>
<br>
	      <h4>Cold Rain - mid 2018</h4>
	      <p><i>Dark, cold, and rainy.<br>
The ravens softly weeping.<br>
		      Hurricane warning.</i></p>
	      <p>Notes: GOD i love when it's like a really small hurricane and it's 4am and it's all quiet except for the house being pummeled by wind and rain and maybe the tv goes brrrr brrr brrrr beeeeee i love it </p>
<br>
<br>
	      <h4>Teeth and Claws - mid 2018</h4>
	      <p><i>Eyes and ears, teeth and claws,<br>
teach me how to rip it off.<br>
Skin and blood, flesh and bones,<br>
		      one more hour, I’ll be home.</i></p>
	      <p>Notes: kinda an intimate(no sexual connotation) poem about dysphoria and having someone to help you get over it</p>
<br>
<br>
	      <h4>Laisez - early 2018</h4>
	      <i><p>wh</i></p>
	    <p>Notes: found on a peice of paper. there was a little side note that said (finish later) that didn't look like it was formatted to be included in the poem. Since it wasn't like, calligraphy or anything i just assumed that it might have been a joke or statement about how lazy i am or smth idek but i put it here for tha archive</p>
