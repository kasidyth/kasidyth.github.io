	      <h1>a note</h1>
	      <p>me've been working toward getting back all of my old writing, dating it, and keeping it stored somewhere. for a really long time, what i would do would be to write something, maybe upload it somewhere, and then in waves i would delete whole collections of my writing. it's been hard, now that i care a lot more about preserving these sorts of things, to go back where i can, pull out old hard drives, etc to find rough drafts of writings. lots of my writing was done pen and paper, or on my typewriter, and then lost or visibly obscured with marker.</p>
	      <p>it sucks hard knowing these years and years of writing, my own history, has been erased due to embarassment. not only that, but other things as well. i don't have any art from long ago, because i wouldn't even save or upload art, i would create and delete. and, of course, regarding local storage, young me was a tech savvy little fuck who encrypted shit and then forgot the password. </p>
	      <p>take as much of this with some context: i'm doing better now, and a lot of these writings being edgy are the ones that i find the most important. as i date the writings to when i think they were made, it gives me insight into remembering what may have caused me to write these poems in the past.. i usually struggle with memory and seeing these helps put into context lots of things about my life. </p>
	      <p>mostly haiku, freeform, maybe a few short stories. lots of my writing is fanfiction but i don't feel like putting any of that there, and NO you will not get to read any. maybe going forward i'll write or put some of my small essays or developed thoughts on things.</p>

	      <h4>Understate - Late 2019</h4>
	      <p><i>I dreamed of you last night. <br>
The black and white girl,<br>
eyes wide open with<br>
“little circles” written on your face.<br>
<br>

I dreamed of you last night. <br>
The euphony of the city,<br>
the ocean, the wind,<br>
Every little thing pouring into my ears.<br>
<br>
I dreamed of you last night,<br> 
and I fully understood <br>
the feelings you have <br>
not yet taken the time to think about.<br>
<br>
I dreamed of you last night,<br> 
dreaming on your way home from school,<br>
with the pressure in your chest <br>
of knowing it was all going to end.<br>
<br>
I dreamed of you last night,<br> 
the sky was falling down<br>
and crashing into the world<br>
you could feel crumbling.<br>
<br>
And that’s okay,<br>
		      as long as you have your dreams.</i></p>
	      <p>Notes: this was made for a writing contest off of an album i like, <a href="https://vill4in.bandcamp.com/album/--5">listen here. it did not win the award, but my other submission did.</a>
