		  <h1>The Ethics of Ambiguity </h1><i><h4>(May 9th, 2025)<h4></i>
		<br><p><i>The Ethics of Ambiguity</i> is a writing by Simone de Beauvoir early into her career as a philosopher, detailing an early system of existentialist ethics. She attempts to describe a system of ethics built on the existentialism outlined in Sartre’s work Being and Nothingness. In her work, Beauvoir does not spend time arguing for a system of morality based on some innate or natural good or evil, but instead focuses her argument on the root of ethics, our ability to make choices as a moral agent, our freedom. She contrasts this freedom with our being a “facticity”, an object to other subjects, something which another’s freedom can be opposed onto. This work was initially drafted in 1946 as a series of texts in Les Temps modernes, the newspaper which Beauvoir and Sartre were founding members of, and then it was published together as a book in 1947. 
		<br>Beauvoir opens with a discourse on Sartre’s Being and Nothingness, describing the “failure” of man as a recognition of the subject’s engaged freedom, the for-oneself, which must also know and capitulate to its existence as an object in the world, the in-oneself. In a traditional system of ethics, this failure has to be resolved, but existentialism explicitly does not do so. Instead, the absurdity of the failure of man is important, because if one attempts to assert their will and their being upon the world around them and succeeds, there is not a question of ethics involved in existence and action. If the passion that allows a person to assert their will is explicit and useful, if it is known to the world, then it has no reason to will itself. The root of ethics hinges on actions being ultimately futile and subjective, so that in the lack of ethical determination an ethical determination can be found - we must give ourselves the purpose we do not have. 
		<br>In defining one’s own purpose, a person may achieve success in embracing the ambiguity of their being. What comes of this is that we may disclose ourselves, we assert our will over ourselves. This, to Beauvoir, is how one may “win” the state of ambiguity, “for the fact is that the world becomes present by his presence in it.” In doing this we will ourselves as free, which in the sense that our moral standard is built on our recognition of our own freedom, also makes us moral. Beauvoir goes on to distinguish that we have natural freedom (as Sartre says even denying our own freedom is a choice we have made), in that we are naturally able to make our own choices, but we are not moral through this. Only through the transformation from natural freedom to genuine freedom do we go from natural beings to moral beings. 
		<br>If freedom is supposed to be our moral good, what is moral evil? Since we are born with a natural freedom and may transform to a moral freedom, the moral evil in existentialist ethics is refusing to accept life’s ambiguity, to refuse an assertion of the self. Evil is in never accepting that there must be a tension between the self and the object, to erase one’s own presence in attempting to run away from needing to assert the self. Existentialist moral evil is acting in “bad faith”, denying one’s own freedom and acting according to the pressures of the world around oneself, being only an object to others as an attempt to escape responsibility. 
		<br>Beauvoir establishes that, after being born with natural freedom, we are children confined to a world with a low ceiling, we are able to make our own decisions but only within the confines of a world where our decisions won’t matter. As the child grows, however, they must break through this ceiling, and recognize their freedom. If they do not recognize their freedom and instead evade it, many types of person may result. The sub-man is the lowest of all, completely apathetic in the face of freedom, denying his consciousness and instead hiding in the emptiness of their soul. The serious man is similar, instead choosing only to select a set of values to replace his responsibility and freedom. Though the world may limit this one similar to the child, there is still an elevation that can occur from recognizing one’s own freedom - this is the dilemma presented to most women, who choose to be a type of woman in service of someone instead of asserting their freedom. 
		<br>There are other types of man described, which each recognize their own freedom, yet act improperly on it. The nihilist recognizes the inability to resolve the failure which drives ethics, but refuses to assert their will, intentionally becoming nothing. The adventurer recognizes their freedom in absurdity, and in some way embraces that freedom in indifference, but is indifferent to cruelty. The adventurer does not exist and assert their freedom towards a fair goal, but instead asserts their freedom for the sake of conquest, aggressively existing in the moment. They assert themselves and their freedom, even if it means asserting it over others, trampling them. The passionate man is the antithesis of the adventurer, refusing to assert themself but asserting the assertation of the other, intentionally choosing to exist as the object so that others may be the subject. The moral compassion is real, but the boundary between themself and their object of passion cannot exist without assertion, and thus it withers away. Beauvoir describes this type of man as being dangerous, too, as its infinitely dedicated assertion of an object will never cede to other subjects, and the passionate man may hurt, destroy, trample others in attempting to attain it. Genuine freedom is a synthesis of the dedicated assertion of the adventurer and the passion of the passionate man for others, along with the recognition of the freedom of other subjects (as the freedom of all is the freedom of one). 
		<br>Beauvoir goes on to critique and discuss different ways in which people with their freedom interact with the world. The aesthetic attitude is built on a detachment from the world, and in being detached from the world, the aesthetic (who we find intellectuals and such in) evades their needing to recognize themselves as the same sort of subject they recognize externally, evading implications of responsibility. Beauvoir also includes discussion of the state of oppressed peoples, whose ceiling is so low the only way they may assert their will is by violent negative revolution against their oppressors - who assert their will, and the wills of others, but treat the oppressed population still as objects. Violence is necessary, so Beauvoir says, to achieve freedom, but questions a few specifics on the necessities of violence, on the necessities of treating one’s oppressors as objects for the freedom of all. Tyrants must be dealt with, unfortunately, with the same tools the tyrant uses to oppress others. Then, Beauvoir relates these discussions of revolution to the morality of action in the present based on unknowable results in the future. 
		<br>Beauvoir’s final points are a discussion of the main theme generally already covered in her work, returning to the question of respecting the freedom of others as a free individual. Instead of the angst and ambiguity of how to exist and become free as an object which is asserted upon, we look instead at the angle of the subject, and how to respect the asserted free others. She claims that all situations are unique, and that there may be no guiding principle to moral action in her system - that we must act originally each time to each original situation, ensuring that we do what we may to assert our own freedom without trampling others. The result of finite, free action towards our goals is the sense of freedom for all, utopian.
